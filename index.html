     <h2 id="subtitle"><strong>About Chinua Achebe</strong></h2>
       <p>Chinua Achebe (/ˈtʃɪnwɑː əˈtʃɛbeɪ/; born Albert Chinụalụmọgụ Achebe, 16 November 1930 – 21 March 2013) was a Nigerian novelist, poet, professor, and critic.[1] His first novel Things Fall Apart (1958), often considered his masterpiece,[2] is the most widely read book in modern African literature.[3]</p>
     <h2>Early Life</h2>
     <p>Achebe was born Albert Chinualumogu Achebe in the Igbo village of Ogidi on 16 November 1930.[7] Isaiah Okafo Achebe and Janet Anaenechi Iloegbunam Achebe stood at a crossroads of traditional culture and Christian influence; this made a significant impact on the children, especially Chinualumogu. After the youngest daughter was born, the family moved to Isaiah Achebe's ancestral town of Ogidi, in what is now the state of Anambra.[1]Storytelling was a mainstay of the Igbo tradition and an integral part of the community. Achebe's mother and sister Zinobia Uzoma told him many stories as a child, which he repeatedly requested. His education was furthered by the collages his father hung on the walls of their home, as well as almanacs and numerous books – including a prose adaptation of A Midsummer Night's Dream (c. 1590) and an Igbo version of The Pilgrim's Progress (1678).[8][9] Chinua also eagerly anticipated traditional village events, like the frequent masquerade ceremonies, which he recreated later in his novels and stories.[10]</p>
     <h2>Achievements</h2>
     <p>Achebe-a novelist,professor and a teacher wrote many books.Among those books are:</p>
     <ui>
       <li>Things Fall Apart</li>
       <li>Arrow of God</li>
       <li>Anthill OF Savanna</li>
       </ui>
     <h2>Family LIfe</h2>
     <p>In the same year Things Fall Apart was published, Achebe was promoted at the NBS and put in charge of the network's eastern region coverage. He moved to Enugu and began to work on his administrative duties. There he met a woman named Christiana Chinwe (Christie) Okoli, who had grown up in the area and joined the NBS staff when he arrived. They first conversed when she brought to his attention a pay discrepancy; a friend of hers found that, although they had been hired simultaneously, Christie had been rated lower and offered a lower wage. Sent to the hospital for an appendectomy soon after, she was pleasantly surprised when Achebe visited her with gifts and magazines.[48]</p>
